The "hadrons-app" folder is a copy of the "application-template" folder at the base of Hadrons. 
I use this compiled executable instead of HadronsXmlRun, i.e. just pass it an XML file as usual
along with whatever Grid parameters (--grid 4.4.4.4 etc.). This lets me compile
tweaks to Hadrons without compiling all of Hadrons. It's configured 
similar to Hadrons and Grid:

./bootstrap.sh

${SRCDIR}/configure \
  --with-hadrons=${HADRONSINSTALLDIR}      \
  --with-grid=${GRIDINSTALLDIR} 


You'll see in hadrons-app/cpp/moduleHelper.cpp the main thing I'm overwriting here
is the template definition for StagLocalCoherenceLanczos. It's compiled here with nBasis=384
instead of the current default of 60, i.e.

MSolver::TLocalCoherenceLanczos<STAGIMPL,384>.

If you happened to have compiled Hadrons already with 

#define HADRONS_DEFAULT_LANCZOS_NBASIS 384

then you can just use HadronsXmlRun instead. Alternatively, you can change 
that line at the top of Hadrons/EigenPack.hpp and recompile Hadrons.
