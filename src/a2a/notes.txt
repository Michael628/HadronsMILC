A2A is computed by contracting left and right vectors in blocks
E - low mode eigenvectors
HW - high mode wall sources
HS - high mode CG solves

The blocks are looped in order:
1. E-E
2. E-HW
3. HS-E
4. HS-HW

The eigenvectors are checkerboarded, which means the first 3 steps involve checkerboarded contractions.

For local gammas:
1. E-E
 - even-even
 - odd-odd
2. E-HW
 - even-Full
 - odd-Full
3. HS-E
 - Full-even
 - Full-odd
4. HS-HW
 - Full-Full

Grid View creation data flow:
1. E-E
2. E-HW
3. HS-E
 *Option 1: Try mapping full volume points to checkerboard. Share full volume views between even and odd tasks
 Option 2: Allocate space for checkerboarded phases, high mode sources, and high mode solves (and later, gauge links).
4. HS-HW
 - Full volume, only one task is used, no sharing required.
